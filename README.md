# Great Uni Hack 2017
This is the webapp for this year's hackathon
## Installation

1. Make sure you have installed `Node.js` installed. Current preferred version is `8.9.x (LTS)`.
2. Clone this repository, preferably over https: `https://github.com/PatrickBuhagiar/GreatUniHack2017WebApp.git`.
4. Install IDE of choice. I use `Visual Studio Code` which comes with typescript support out of the box. If you prefer another IDE, make sure to install any relevant plugins to support typescript. 
    * I followed this [setup guide](http://blog.tomduncalf.com/posts/setting-up-typescript-and-react/). You should definitely give it a read so that you can understand how this project was setup. I have added comments with improvements to the guide.    
    * At least in VSC, I would not recommend installing `tslint` because it makes the IDE much slower. 
3. In command prompt or console run:
    ```
    npm install && npm start
    ```
4. access [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
